ObscuraPlus
===========

ObscuraPlus helps users view, edit, and clear the Exif information of their images.
What is Exif? It stands for Exchangeable Image File Format. Most cameras including smartphones store extra information (metadata), when you take a picture; for example the type of camera, date, time, location, aperture, flash etc... The extra information captured by your camera is called EXIF data.
ObscuraPlus gives the user control over what he or she wants to share with everyone else. For e.g. if one does not want to share any detail of where, when or how their image was taken, one has the option to do just that. The image will be void of any Exif data at all. The same way, one can also chose to may be share the basic data as where, when etc was the image taken and what camera was used.
